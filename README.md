# EDA- World-Country-Data-Exploration-using-SQL-Workbench
Hello everyone, this time I made an exploratory data analysis on data from all countries in the world. This data included information about the area, population, languages , cities, income, life expectancy, and more. Additionally, I also practiced commonly used SQL queries.
Thanks
